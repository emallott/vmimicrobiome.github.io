## Welcome to the VMI Microbiome Boot Camp II Preview!

**This page will help prepare you for the VMI Microbiome Boot Camp II on February 26, 2021.**

### ABOUT THE VMI 

The [Vanderbilt Microbiome Initiative (VMI)](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/microbiome/) brings together an unprecedented group of multidisciplinary expertise from six schools in the university to: (i) create an infrastructure that unifies the microbiome community around complex challenges, (ii) catalyze campus-wide research, training, and teaching activities, and (iii) deploy state-of-the-science technologies and methods that will fundamentally advance microbiome science, therapy, education, and policy.

From bacteria to archaea, viruses, and single-celled eukaryotes, communities of microbes have major impacts on our health, our homes, our genomes, the oceans, atmosphere, and biodiversity. The Vanderbilt Microbiome Initiative is producing research, education, and outreach that will improve basic, translational, and clinical science, spur new aspects of law and and philosophy, and expose a microbial world astonishing in its universality and diversity.

### What To Expect From This Boot Camp

We will be using the command line to interact with Qiime. You can learn more about the basics of command line [here](https://youtu.be/5XgBd6rjuDQ) if you're on a Mac (UNIX) and [here](https://youtu.be/MBBWVgE0ewk) if you're on a computer running Windows. Don't worry if you've never used it before, we will walk you through each step during the boot camp and you will be able to copy and paste along with us from this very GitHub page.

```markdown 
Here's what that will look like when we encounter code together during the boot camp:
``This is code that you can copy and paste right 
into your command line during the boot camp =D``
```
Once we process our microbiome data we will jump over to [MicrobiomeAnalyst](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca) to upload our data and use a Graphical User Interface aka GUI (_pronouced "gooey"_) to analyze and visualize our microbiome data. 

If you want to [learn more about alpha and beta diversity](https://youtu.be/CQaFT_vVQvw) before the boot camp, watch this video for a gentle introduction. 
### What To Do Before The Boot Camp

1) The main thing we need to do to be prepared for the boot camp is [install Qiime on a Mac](https://youtu.be/1vRQ2MPRRpo) or [install Qiime on a Windows PC](https://youtu.be/b4l_wIJ1dwE) and make sure it runs! 

**If you're not able to get it running then make an zoom appointment with the [VMI team](mailto:robert.h.markowitz@vanderbilt.edu) and we'll try to trouble shoot it along with you. We have avaialbility every Monday and Friday from 12PM-1PM until the 26th.**

2) At 9AM CST on Friday, February 26th this page will magically update so all you have to do is return here in the morning and you will find all of the content for the boot camp and an zoom invite in your inbox to attend the boot camp.

### That's all for now, microbe hunters! We'll see you soon!
